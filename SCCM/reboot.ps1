    .SYNOPSIS
        Mandatory Reboot with Log Validation, Age Checks, and Test Override

    .DESCRIPTION
        Triggers a soft reboot if:
        - The last reboot (Event ID 1074) is older than threshold, or
        - No reboot event exists, but logs go back at least $MinLogAge days.
        Skips reboot if logs are too young to trust or reboot is recent.
        Allows testing via C:\reboottest.txt override.

    .NOTES
        Exit Codes:
        0    - Success, no reboot needed
        3010 - Reboot needed and will be triggered
             - Also returned when override file is present
        1001 - Failed to retrieve system logs
        1002 - No system logs found
        1003 - Logs too young to make determination (< MinLogAge days)
